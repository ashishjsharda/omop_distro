# README #

This project integrates the differnt parts of OMOP into a running setup.  

It's probably largely a re-implementation of what happens inside ETl projects like Synthea-ETL. The goal isn't to be prescriptive or to be make-work. It's an attempt to figure out how this works, how to do ETL in my own project, and to document it.

### How do I get set up? ###

* run build.sh

## Issues

* DDL comes in different forms, uses different methods for naming the schema of a sub-project.
* see also TODO tags in the scripts.

### Who do I talk to? ###

* Chris Roeder, chris.roeder@cuanschutz.edu
* ohdsi.org of course
